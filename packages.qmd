## Adding Additional Packages in R/Python

The ADRF has an internal package repository, so users can install packages for R and Python themselves.

## R packages

To install R packages, simply type:

`install.packages("packagename")`

and the package will be installed from the repository. You will not have to re-install the package again, and to use the package load it with the `library()` function. For example:

`library(tidyverse`)

All packages will be installed in your user folder.

We recommend starting R using Rstudio for best results, instead of double clicking on a R or Rmarkdown script.

## Python packages

Similar to R packages, Python packages may be installed using the Package Installer for Python (pip).

We recommend installing python packages from the command line. If you start Jupyter lab, and choose the Terminal tab:

Then install your package using pip, for example, to install the `pandas` package:

Then you may use the package within your Jupyter notebook as usual.
