# 10 Adding Additional Packages in R/Python

The ADRF has an internal package repository, so users can install packages for R and Python themselves.

The repositories that are currently mirrored in the ADRF are [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) for R packages and [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/) for Python. There is currently no access to packages hosted on Github or other mirrors.

**Note**: If you are working in a shared workspace for a project, each user in the project must install the packages, there is no shared package installation for projects.

## Add additional R packages

To install R packages, simply use the code below and the package will be installed from the repository. You will not have to re-install the package again, and to use the package load it with the library() function. For example:

``` r
install.packages("packagename")
```

** Example**: Installing `tidyverse`

To install a specific package version you can specify:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_version("tidyverse", "1.3.2")
```

**Note**: We recommend starting R using Rstudio for best results, instead of double clicking on a R or Rmarkdown script.

## Add additional Python packages

Similar to R packages, Python packages may be installed using the Package Installer for Python (pip).

**Note**: We recommend installing python packages from the command line. If you start Jupyter lab, and choose the Terminal tab:

Then install your package using pip, for example, to install the pandas package:

![Example: pandas package installation](images/pip.png)

Then you may use the package within your Jupyter notebook as usual.

To install a **specific package version** type: 
``` python
pip install pandas==1.2.3
```
