The email will come from [http://okta.com](http://okta.com/ "http://okta.com"), so please make sure that it doesn't get caught in your email spam filter.

-   In the Management Portal, you will notice a "Onboarding Tasks" section within "Admin Tasks" with a number of items you will need to complete before you can gain access to the project space. Refer to the next section for details about the onboarding process.

## **Obtaining ADRF Access**

-   Agency-affiliated researcher. If you are an agency-affiliated researcher using an agency-sponsored account, you will be granted ADRF access once you complete your onboarding tasks and required data access agreements. If you are an self-paying agency-affiliated researcher, your ADRF access is conditional on receipt of payment. If your institution of Office of Sponsored Programs will be submitting payment on your behalf, please be aware of potential access delays. Whenever possible, the Coleridge Initiative advises paying with a personal credit card or institutional payment card and using the generated invoice to request reimbursement.
