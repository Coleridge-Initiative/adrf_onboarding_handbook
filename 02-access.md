## Account Setup {#account-setup}

-   **Agency-affiliated researcher**. If you are an agency-affiliated researcher, your agency will set up an ADRF account for you.
-   **Individual part of a training program**. If you are part of a [training program](https://coleridgeinitiative.org/applied-data-analytics-training-programs), the Coleridge Initiative team will create an account for you once you have been accepted into the program.

## Obtaining ADRF Access

-   **Agency-affiliated researcher**. If you are an agency-affiliated researcher using an agency-sponsored account, you will be granted ADRF access once you complete your onboarding tasks and required data access agreements. If you are a self-paying agency-affiliated researcher, your ADRF access is conditional on receipt of payment. If your institution of Office of Sponsored Programs will be submitting payment on your behalf, please be aware of potential access delays. Whenever possible, the Coleridge Initiative advises paying with a personal credit card or institutional payment card and using the generated invoice to request reimbursement.
-   **Individual part of a training program**. If you are part of a training program, you will be granted ADRF access once you complete your onboarding tasks and required data access agreements.
