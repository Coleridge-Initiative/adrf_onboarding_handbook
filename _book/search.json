    "text": "Data Stewardship App\nThee Data Stewardship web-based application is positioned primarily as the management and monitoring console for project and data stewards. It provides detailed insight on project configurations, user activity, user onboarding status, and overall cost of a project on the ADRF. We focus on four primary pillars of information a Project/Data Steward most often focuses on:\n\nPeople – Who are the members of projects, how often do they use the ADRF, what exports have they requested and their status, estimated cost per person/project for current month and for the project since inception, and detailed usage metrics.\nProjects – Details of project start/end dates, abstract description, number of members onboarded and pending, and resources the project has access to (i.e. datasets, etc).\nDatasets – Description of the dataset, location on the ADRF (database or file system), size, name of the data steward(s), and the link to Enterprise Data Catalog (Informatica) describing the dataset and metadata.\nAgreements – What agreements are related to these projects, indication of each member’s signing status, members pending signature, and term (dates) covered by the agreement(s).\n\nAs mentioned, the data stewardship application will track your ADRF usage. The app will also consolidate your ADRF Terms of Use, Security Training Quiz, and Security Training Video into one place. In order to complete ADRF onboarding, all three of the mentioned tasks are to be completed by the user (researcher). To access the Data Stewardship app, log in using your credentials at https://adrf.okta.com and click on the Data Stewardship icon. See picture below:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce inside the Data Stewardship app, you have access to your personal workspace sessions statistics and the three tasks. See the example below:"

    "text": "Virtual Desktop Environment\n\nWhat is a VDE?\nPurpose, Contents, Capabilities\nA virtual desktop environment (VDE) allows you to interact with a remote system as if it were your own personal computer. The majority of your standard desktop functions are available, but the programs, data, and permissions are all controlled by the remote administrator (Coleridge Initiative). Thus, you will be working in a familiar environment while accessing protected data, programs, and systems that would otherwise be difficult to distribute. The ADRF uses a standard Windows environment (Windows Server) and provides a variety of software packages to conduct your analysis. For more on Windows capabilities, see the section on Windows Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary Nature of the Environment\nWhile the environment is similar to that on your home computer (for Windows users), there are a handful of key differences. The first is that the environment is temporary in nature. This means that if you are not using it for a prolonged period of time (default is four hours but can vary by project), running programs will stop running and the information stored in temporary locations will be deleted. You will receive on on-screen message before any sessions are terminated. For more on safe, non-temporary storage locations in the ADRF, see the section on Storing Analytic Results.\nGiven the temporary nature of the ADRF, it is crucial to make sure that your work is saved—and saved in an appropriate location. Once this is complete and you are finished working, make sure that you log out of the ADRF instead of closing the window. To do this, click the rightmost icon on the top taskbar to open up the dropdown menu and select End Session. You will be prompted to double-check that your work is saved prior to ending your session and confirm that you want to end your session."

    "text": "Modifying the Environment\n\nEstablishing Personal Folders\nEstablishing your own personal folders is one of the simplest, yet most important, steps to take when setting up your environment. As we note in the section on Storing Analytic Results, the two possible places to store your analytic results or files are in either the U: drive or the P: drive.\nYou will find your personal folder in the U: drive. The folder name will include your Firstname and Lastname, and may additionally include your project workspace number. This is a personal workspace that only you can access in the ADRF.\n\n\nThe U: Drive and the P: Drive\nThe U: drive is your user drive; it’s where you will store any files you are working on. Only the user will have access to the U: drive. For example, if user A wants to share information with user B who is on the same project, user A will need to save files to a P: drive folder and not folders in their U: drive since user B will not be able to access user A’s U: drive.\nThe P: drive is the project drive, which will be used to house project-specific folders. Thus, you and other collaborators on the same project will be able to save files to project drive folders.\nBoth the U: drive and P: drive have defined resource limitations of 150GB. When the workspace exceeds these limits, users will not be able to create new files or save data. The ADRF will not alert users when they approach on 150GB used. Users can check their current usage by right clicking on the user folder and clicking on properties.\n\n\nOther Modifications\nThe top taskbar contains shortcuts to the command prompt, multiple desktop windows, a temporary folder, settings, full-screen view, and toggling multiple monitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Settings\nYour desktop will look familiar if you are a Windows user. You will have icons for quick access to programs or browsers on your desktop. The windows icon on the bottom left side of the screen will open up a menu of programs, folders, and other tools, much as you would see on your own desktop. You will have access to PowerShell and several customization settings (e.g., remove bottom taskbar)."

    "text": "Software in the ADRF\n\nJupyterLab\nJupyterLab provides flexible building blocks for interactive, exploratory computing. While JupyterLab has many features found in traditional integrated development environments (IDEs), it remains focused on interactive, exploratory computing. For more on JupyterLab, see the interface documentation.\nThe JupyterLab interface on the ADRF consists of a main work area containing tabs of documents and activities, a collapsible left sidebar, and a menu bar. The left sidebar contains a file browser, the list of running terminals and kernels, the table of contents, and the extension manager.\n\nWhen using Jupyter Notebooks, make sure that all your work is saved to your U: drive and the correct director within the U: drive. You can “nd the active directory by reading the path displayed in the file browser. By default, JupyterLab opens with your U: drive as the base directory. Below, the folder icon in the white box is my user folder (not displayed, but titled Firstname.Lastname; you will have already set up your folder) and subfolder WDQI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotebooks\nJupyter Notebooks are documents that combine live runnable code with narrative text (Markdown), equations (LaTeX), images, interactive visualizations, and other rich output. You can create a notebook by clicking the blue + button in the file browser and then selecting a kernel (R, Python3, Stata) in the Launcher tab. For more information on getting started with Jupyter Notebooks, see JupyterLab Notebook documentation.\n\n\nAccessing Stored Data from a Notebook\nA common question is how to access stored data while writing to and using a Jupyter Notebook. Data in the ADRF are stored in a database using Microsoft SQL Server. For more information on how to access stored data in the ADRF based on choice of program (Python, R, Stata), see the section on Accessing Your Data.\n\n\nPython 3\nPython is a general-purpose programming language. You can access Python in a multitude of ways:\n\nThrough the start menu (windows icon). Type in Python. A desktop app called Python 3.7 (64-bit) will populate a window where you can begin programming.\n\n\n\nThrough the command prompt in the top taskbar. Once the command prompt window is open, type in python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough JupyterLab. !is is the recommended way to access Python since it has packages installed and available, and an execution environment for testing and running code (as well as a place to write and save code). Open JupyterLab and make sure your directory is set appropriately in the “le browser. Once there, in your new Launcher window, click the Python 3 icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Through Pycharm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\nR is a general-purpose programming language. You may access R in one of three ways:\n\nThrough RStudio. This is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You can run R code, display variables, debug R code, do inline visualizations, and more. Open RStudio through the desktop shortcut, or type RStudio in the start menu.\nThrough JupyterLab. Open JupyterLab and make sure your directory is set appropriately in the file browser. Once there, in your new Launcher window, click the R icon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough the R GUI (graphical user interface). Type R in the search bar and click to open the RGui.\n\n\n\nStata\nStata is a general-purpose statistical so#ware package. Stata can be accessed through the desktop shortcut StataMP 16 or by searching for it using the search or menu bar, or through JupyterLab.\n\n\nDBeaver\nDBeaver is a universal tool for querying, editing, and managing data stored in Redshift databases. The ADRF stores data using AWS Redshift Server. DBeaver can be accessed through the desktop shortcut DBeaver or by looking it up using the search bar.\nOnce open, you will need to connect to a Redshift server. Please follow the directions in the Redshift Querying Guide Appendix 11.1 section of this guide to connect to the appropriate server.\n\n\nDatabase Navigator\nOn the left side of DBeaver, a pane labeled Database Navigator allows you to easily explore what is in the server to which you are connected. By clicking the arrow, all the items within each server, Database, Schema, etc., are shown. When exploring these data and writing SQL queries, it is frequently useful to have the navigator expanded to see more easily what columns are in each table and their data type; the datatype can be seen in the screenshot to the right in parentheses next to each column name (e.g., clientid(char64) is a text column of length 64— for our purposes you can ignore the char… and varchar… and simply treat it as text).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSQL Editor\nThe SQL Editor is where you can write your own queries to analyze the data. A new script can be opened by clicking on the blue almost-square (looks a bit like an unrolled scroll) on DBeaver's tool bar:\nThe location of this script button is circled in the red in the upper left of the screenshot below.\n\nNote: If you use the SQL button to open a new window, it will prompt you to select a data source and enter your username and password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have a SQL Editor window open, you can write a query and run it. One option to run a query is to use the keyboard to hit ctrl+enter, and another option is to use the orange triangle.\n\n\nOpen a saved .sql FIle\nYou do not have to create a new script every time! You can open a .sql file either by simply dragging and dropping it from the file explorer, or by going to File → Open File and navigating to a .sql file, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have done so, the top of your SQL Editor window should name the server connection inside the angle brackets to the left of the filename (&lt;Redshift11_projects&gt;).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibreOffice\nLibreOffice is an office productivity suite. LibreOffice comes equipped with six different programs: a word processor program (Writer), a spreadsheet program (Calc), a presentation program (Impress), a graphics editor program (Draw), a math equation program (Math), and a database management program akin to Microsoft Access (Base). LibreOffice may be accessed through the desktop shortcut DBeaver or by looking it up using the search bar. Once you've opened up LibreOffice, you can open any of those six programs, using the left sidebar. For more information on LibreOffice, visit the LibreOffice website.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you click on the icon, you'll see a page with a left sidebar that has a variety of document types under Create. Select the one suited to your needs and double click to open it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore…\nThe ADRF provides a number of additional programs such as a simple text editor (Notepad++), PyCharm (an IDE for Python users), and several web browsers. Please note that web browsers are limited only to approved websites."

    "text": "Export Review Guidelines\nTo provide ADRF users with the ability to draw from sensitive data, results that are exported from the ADRF must meet rigorous standards meant to protect privacy and confidentiality. To ensure that those standards are met, the ADRF Export Review team reviews each request to ensure that it follows formal guidelines that are set by the respective agency providing the data in partnership with the Coleridge Initiative. Prior to moving data into the ADRF from the agency, the Export Review team suggests default guidelines to implement, based on standard statistical approaches in the U.S. government 1, 2 as well as international standards 3, 4, and 5. The Data Steward from the agency supplying the data works with the team to amend these default rules in line with the agency’s requirements. If you are unsure about the review guidelines for the data you are using in the ADRF or if you have any questions relating to exports, please reach out to support@coleridgeinitiative.org before submitting an export request.\nTo learn more about limiting disclosure more generally, please refer to the textbook or view the videos.\n\nGeneral Best Practices for a Successful Export\n\nCurrently, the review process is highly manual: Reviewers will read your code and view your output files, which may be time-consuming.\nEach additional release adds disclosure risk and therefore limits subsequent releases; we ask that users limit the number of files they request to export to just the outputs necessary to produce a particular report or paper. If you are requesting an export of more than 10 files, there may be an additional charge.\nThe reviewers may ask you to make changes to your code or output to meet the requirements of guidelines that have been given by the providers of the data in the ADRF. Thus, we strongly encourage you to produce all output files—tables with rounded numbers, graphs with titles, and so forth—through code, rather than manually.\nWe ask that you only request review of final versions of output files, rather than in-progress versions. Any file containing intermediate output will be rejected.\nEvery code file should have a header describing the contents of the file, including a summary of the data manipulation that takes place in the file (e.g., regression, table or figure creation, etc.).\nDocumenting code by using comments throughout is helpful for disclosure reviews. The better the documentation, the faster the turnaround of export requests. If data files are aggregated, please provide documentation on the level of aggregation and for where in the code the aggregation takes place.\nTo help reviewers, who may not have seen your code before, we ask that users create meaningful variable names. For instance, if you are calculating outflows, it is better to name the variable “outflows” than to name it “var1.”\n\n\n\nTimelines for Export Process\n\nColeridge reviewers have five business days to complete an export from the day you submit an export request. However, timelines may differ depending on your agency, so please refer to your specific agency’s guidelines.\nThe review process can be delayed if the reviewer needs additional information or if the reviewer needs you to make changes to your code or output to meet the ADRF nondisclosure requirements."

    "text": "Preparing Data for Export\n\nTables\n\nCell Sizes\n\nEach agency has specific disclosure review guidelines, especially with respect to the minimum allowable cell sizes for tables. Refer to these guidelines when preparing export requests. If you are unsure of what guidelines are in place for the dataset with which you are working in the ADRF, please reach out to support@coleridgeinitiative.org.\nFor individual-level data, please report the number of observations from each cell. For individual-level data, the default rule is to suppress cells with fewer than 10 observations, unless otherwise directed by the guidelines of the agency that provided the data.\nIf your table includes row or column totals or is dependent on a preceding or subsequent table, reviewers will need to take into account complementary disclosure risks—that is, whether the tables’ totals, or the separate tables when read together, might disclose information about individuals in the data in a way that a single, simpler table would not. Reviewers will work with you by offering guidance on implementing any necessary complementary suppression techniques.\n\nWeighted Data\n\nIf weighted results are to be exported, you must report both weighted and unweighted counts.\n\nRatios\n\nIf ratios are reported, please report the number of valid cases for both the numerator and the denominator (e.g., number of men in state X and number of women in state X, in addition to the ratio of women in state X).\n\nPercentiles\n\nDo not report exact percentiles. Instead, for example, you may calculate a “fuzzy median,” by averaging the true 45th and 55th percentiles.\n\nPercentages\n\nFor any reported percentages or proportions, the underlying counts of individuals contributing to the numerators and denominators must be provided for each statistic in the desired export.\n\nMaxima and Minima\n\nSuppress maximum and minimum values in general.\nYou may replace an exact maximum or minimum with a top-coded value.\n\n\n\n\nGraphs\n\nGraphs are representations of tables. Thus, for each graph (which may have, e.g., a jpg, pdf, png, or tif extension), provide the source data of the underlying table of the graph following the guidelines for tables above.\nBecause graphs and other figures take the most time to review, the number of generated graphs should be as low as possible. Please consider the possibility that you could export the underlying table instead, and generate the graph in another package.\nIf a graph is produced from aggregated data or from tables that have been disclosure-proofed following the guidelines above (e.g., bar charts of magnitudes), provide the underlying tables.\nIf a graph is produced directly from unit-record data but aggregated in the visualization (e.g., frequency histograms), provide the underlying tables.\nIf a graph is produced directly from unit-record data and displays unit-record values (e.g., scatterplots, plots of residuals), the graph can be released only after you ensure that individuals cannot be re-identified and that values can only be estimated with a high level of uncertainty. Further processing to meet this requirement can include, but is not restricted to, cutting off the tails of a distribution, removing outliers, jittering the actual values, and removing or modifying axis values.\nIf a graph is produced from the results of modeling or derivation and uses the unit-record data (e.g., regression curves), the graph can be released only if the values cannot be used to find original data values.\n\nGraphs of this type are generally automatically cleared.\nFor precision/recall graphs, you will need to report the sample size used to generate your model(s).\n\n\n\n\nModel Output\n\nOutput from regression or machine-learning models generally does not pose a risk of disclosing personally identifiable information, as long as the models are not based on small samples. Provide the counts for each variable that produces the model output. If categorical variables are used then provide the counts for each category."

This page, titled “Create Export Request,” will ask for you to comment on all supporting code files to explain the commands used to generate the files in the export request. The Export Review team will reject all requests containing intermediate output, and there should be no more than 10 separate files for export unless approval is given in advance. The Export Review team will typically release export requests within five business days. However, if the team has any clarifying questions, this could result in a longer review process. You need to document your output files in the text box provided. See the example below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have read through and followed the page instructions, and are ready to proceed:\n\nMove the slider at the bottom of the page to indicate that you have followed the page’s guidelines.\nAt the bottom of the page, upload each of the files that you have prepared.\nClick Submit Request… to create the export request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can click My Requests at the left side of the window to view your current and previous export requests.\n\nTo learn more about exporting results, please watch these videos."
