# 11 Redshift Querying Guide

This section provides an introduction to generating proficient Amazon Redshift queries. This is a generalized document meaning you will need to replace “schema_name” and “table_name” with the appropriate schema and table names used for your project.

**Note**: All data is stored under schemas in the projects database.

## Data access {#data-access}

If you are approved to access data that are stored in a database, the data are housed in Redshift. To access those data, you will have to log in to Redshift within your workspace.

You need to replace the “user.name.project” with your **project workspace username**. The **project workspace username** is your user folder name in the U:/ drive:

![Image of Project-Based User Name](images/ap1.png)

**Note**: You will need to enter your specific user name when logging into Redshift. The password needed to access Redshift is the second password entered when logging into the ADRF as shown in the screen below: <br>

![Image of Password Entry](images/ap2.png)

## Using DBeaver to access a database {#using-dbeaver-to-access-a-database}

To establish a connection to Redshift in DBeaver, first open DBeaver by clicking on the DBeaver icon located on the ADRF desktop and then double click on the server you wish to connect to. **Note**: All data is stored under schemas in the projects database.

In the example below, we will connect to **Redshift11_projects**. After double clicking on Reshift11_projects, a window will appear asking for your **Username** and **Password**.

-   In Username, enter **"adrf\\"** followed by your **project workspace username**
-   In Password, enter the password associated with your project workspace username ![Complete the Username and Password fields](images/ap3.png)

After completing the Username and Password fields, click **OK**. You will now have access to your data stored on the Redshift11_projects server.

**Note**: Please make sure to enter **"adrf\\"** before your project workspace username in the **Username** field. If you do not enter "adrf", or accidently include a "/" instead of a "\\", you will not be able to connect to Redshift. **If you are having trouble connecting, an incorrect entry in Username is most likely the culprit.**

### Creating tables in a PR or TR schema in Dbeaver {#creating-tables-in-a-pr-or-tr-schema-in-dbeaver}

When users create tables in their PR (Research Project) or TR (Training Project) schema, the table is initially permissioned to the user only. This is analogous to creating a document or file in your U drive: Only you have access to the newly created table.

If you want to allow all individuals in your project workspace to access the table in the PR/TR schema, you will need to grant permission to the table to the rest of the users who have access to the PR or TR schema.

You can do this by running the following code: `GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT ON TABLE schema_name.table_name TO group db_xxxxxx_rw;`

**Note**: Note: In the above code example replace schma*name with the pr* or tr\_ schema assigned to your workspace and replace table_name with the name of the table on which you want to grant access. Also, in the group name `db_xxxxxx_rw`, replace `xxxxxx` with your project code. This is the last 6 characters in your project based user name. This will start with either a T or a P.

If you want to allow **only a single user** on your project to access the table, you will need to grant permission to that user. You can do this by running the following code:

`GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT ON TABLE schema_name.table_name to "IAM:first_name.last_name.project_code";`

**Note**: In the above code example replace schma*name with the pr* or tr\_ schema assigned to your workspace and replace table_name with the name of the table on which you want to grant access. Also, in `"IAM:first_name.last_name.project_code"` update `first_name.last_name.project_code` with the user name to whom you want to grant access to.

## Connecting to a database through a statistical program {#connecting-to-a-database-through-a-statistical-program}

When connecting to the database using an ODBC connection, you need to use one of the following DSNs:

-   `Redshift01_projects_DSN`
-   `Redshift11_projects_DSN`

In the code examples below, the default DSN is `Redshift01_projects_DSN`.

-   [Connecting to a database using Python](#connecting-to-a-database-using-python)
-   [Connecting to a database using Stata](#connecting-to-a-database-using-stata)

### Connecting to a database using SAS {#connecting-to-a-database-using-sas}

Use the following code to connect to a databse using SAS:

``` sas
proc sql;
connect to odbc as my con
(datasrc=Redshift01_projects_DSN user=adrf\user.name.project password=password);
select * from connection to mycon
(select * form projects.schema.table);
disconnect from mycon;
quit;
```

-   [Best practices for loading large amounts of data in R](#best-practices-for-loading-large-amounts-of-data-in-r)

#### Recommended method for connecting to a database using R

**Note**: To use this method, you may need to install the packages RJDBC and rstudioapi first.

``` r
library(RJDBC)

# Create username
dbusr=paste("ADRF\\", Sys.getenv("USERNAME"), sep= '')

# Database URL
url <- paste0("jdbc:redshift:iam://adrf-redshift01.cdy8ch2udktk.us-gov-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/projects;",
              "loginToRp=urn:amazon:webservices:govcloud;",
              "ssl=true;",
              "AutoCreate=true;",
              "idp_host=adfs.adrf.net;",
              "idp_port=443;",
              "ssl_insecure=true;",
              "plugin_name=com.amazon.redshift.plugin.AdfsCredentialsProvider")

# Redshift JDBC Driver Setting
driver <- JDBC("com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver",
               classPath = "C:\\drivers\\redshift_withsdk\\redshift-jdbc42-2.1.0.12\\redshift-jdbc42-2.1.0.12.jar",
               identifier.quote="`")
con <- dbConnect(driver, url, dbusr, rstudioapi::askForPassword())
```

#### Using Renviron file to connect to a database using R {#using-renviron-file-to-connect-to-a-database-using-r}

``` r
library(RJDBC)
dbusr=Sys.getenv("DBUSER")                                                                    dbpswd=Sys.getenv("DBPASSWD")

# Database URL
url <- paste0("jdbc:redshift:iam://adrf-redshift01.cdy8ch2udktk.us-gov-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/projects;",
"loginToRp=urn:amazon:webservices:govcloud;",
"ssl=true;",
"AutoCreate=true;",
"idp_host=adfs.adrf.net;",
"idp_port=443;",
"ssl_insecure=true;",
"plugin_name=com.amazon.redshift.plugin.AdfsCredentialsProvider")

# Redshift JDBC Driver Setting
driver <- JDBC("com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver",
classPath = "C:\\drivers\\redshift_withsdk\\redshift-jdbc42-2.1.0.12\\redshift-jdbc42-2.1.0.12.jar",
identifier.quote="`")
conn <- dbConnect(driver, url, dbusr, dbpswd)
```

**Note**: For the above code to work, please create a file name .Renviron in your user folder (user folder is something like i.e. `u:\John.doe.p00002`) And `.Renviron` file should contain the following:

``` r
DBUSER='adrf\John.doe.p00002'
DBPASSWD='xxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

\_ **Note** replace `user id` and `password` with your project workspace specific user id and password.

This will ensure you don’t have your id and password in R code and then you can easily share your R code with others without sharing your ID and password.\_

#### Best practices for loading large amounts of data in R {#best-practices-for-loading-large-amounts-of-data-in-r}

##### SQL Basics with R Programming

To ensure R can efficiently manage large amounts of data, please add the following lines of code to your R script before any packages are loaded:

``` r
options(java.parameters = c("-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC", "-Xmx8192m"))
gc()
```

##### Best practices for writing tables to Redshift

When writing an R data frame to Redshift use the following code as an example:

``` r
# Note: replace the table_name with the name of the data frame you wish to write to Redshift

DBI::dbWriteTable(conn = conn, #name of the connection
name = "schema_name.table_name", #name of table to save df to
value = df_name, #name of df to write to Redshift
overwrite = TRUE) #if you want to overwrite a current table, otherwise FALSE

qry <- "GRANT SELECT ON TABLE schema.table_name TO group <group_name>;"
dbSendUpdate(conn,qry)
```

### Connecting to a database using Python {#connecting-to-a-database-using-python}

``` python
import pyodbc
import pandas as pd
cnxn = pyodbc.connect('DSN=Redshift01_projects_DSN; UID=adrf\user.name.project; PWD=password')
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM projects.schema_name.table_name", cnxn)
```

### Connecting to a database using Stata {#connecting-to-a-database-using-stata}

``` stata
odbc load, exec("select * from PATH_TO_TABLE") clear dsn("Redshift11_projects_DSN") user("adrf\user.name.project") password("password")
```

## Redshift Query Guidelines for Researchers {#redshift-query-guidelines-for-researchers}

*Developing your query*. Here’s an example workflow to follow when developing a query.

1.  Study the column and table metadata, which is accessible via the table definition. Each table definition can be displayed by clicking on the \[+\] next the table name.
2.  To get a feel for a table’s values, `SELECT * from` the tables you’re working with and LIMIT your results (Keep the LIMIT applied as you refine your columns) or use (e.g., `select * from [table name] LIMIT 1000`)
3.  Narrow down the columns to the minimal set required to answer your question.
4.  Apply any filters to those columns.
5.  If you need to aggregate data, aggregate a small number of rows
6.  Once you have a query returning the results you need, look for sections of the query to save as a Common Table Expression (CTE) to encapsulate that logic.

### Query Tips and Best Practices

#### Tip 1: Use `SELECT <columns>` instead of `SELECT *`

Specify the columns in the SELECT clause instead of using `SELECT *`. The unnecessary columns place extra load on the database, which slows down not just the single Amazon Redshift, but the whole system.

**Inefficient**

`SELECT * FROM projects.schema_name.table_name`

This query fetches all the data stored in the table you choose which might not be required for a particular scenario.

**Efficient**

`SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C FROM projects.schema_name.table_name`

#### Tip 2: Always fetch limited data and target accurate results

Lesser the data retrieved, the faster the query will run. Rather than applying too many filters on the client-side, filter the data as much as possible at the server. This limits the data being sent on the wire and you’ll be able to see the results much faster. In Amazon Redshift use `LIMIT (###)` qualifier at the end of the query to limit records.

`SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C FROM projects.schema_name.table_name WHERE [apply some filter] LIMIT 1000`

#### Tip 3: Use wildcard characters wisely

Wildcard characters can be either used as a prefix or a suffix. Using leading wildcard (`%`) in combination with an ending wildcard will search all records for a match anywhere within the selected field.

**Inefficient**

`Select col_A, col_B, col_C from projects.schema_name.table_name where col_A like '%BRO%'`

This query will pull the expected results of *Brown Sugar, Brownie, Brown Rice* and so on. However, it will also pull unexpected results, such as *Country Brown, Lamb with Broth, Cream of Broccoli*.

**Efficient**

`Select col_A, col_B, col_C from projects.schema_name.table_name where col_B like 'BRO%'.`

This query will pull only the expected results of *Brownie, Brown Rice, Brown Sugar* and so on.

#### Tip 4: Does My record exist?

Normally, developers use `EXISTS()` or `COUNT()` queries for matching a record entry. However, `EXISTS()` is more efficient as it will exit as soon as finding a matching record; whereas, `COUNT()` will scan the entire table even if the record is found in the first row.

**Efficient**

`select col_A from projects.schema_name.table_name A where exists (select 1 from projects.schema_name.table_name B where A.col_A = B.col_A ) order by col_A;`

#### Tip 5: Avoidcorrelated subqueries

A correlated subquery depends on the parent or outer query. Since it executes row by row, it decreases the overall speed of the process.

**Inefficient**

`SELECT col_A, col_B, (SELECT col_C FROM projects.schema_name.table_name_a WHERE col_C = c.rma LIMIT 1) AS new_name FROM projects.schema_name.table_name_b`

Here, the problem is that the inner query is run for each row returned by the outer query. Going over the `table_name_b` table again and again for every row processed by the outer query creates process overhead. Instead, for Amazon Redshift query optimization, use `JOIN` to solve such problems.

**Efficient**

`SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C FROM projects.schema_name.table_name c LEFT JOIN projects.schema_name.table_name co ON c.col_A = co.col_B`

#### Tip 6: Avoid using Amazon Redshift function in the where condition

Often developers use functions or methods with their Amazon Redshift queries.

**Inefficient**

`SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C FROM projects.schema_name.table_name WHERE RIGHT(birth_date,4) = '1965' and LEFT(birth_date,2) = '07'`

Note that even if `birth_date` has an index, the above query changes the `WHERE` clause in such a way that this index cannot be used anymore.

**Efficient**

`SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C FROM projects.schema_name.table_name WHERE birth_date between '711965' and '7311965'`

#### Tip 7: Use WHERE instead of HAVING

`HAVING` clause filters the rows after all the rows are selected. It is just like a filter. Do not use the `HAVING` clause for any other purposes. It is useful when performing group bys and aggregations.

#### Tip 8: Use temp tables when merging large data sets

Creating local temp tables will limit the number of records in large table joins and merges. Instead of performing large table joins, one can break out the analysis by performing the analysis in two steps:

1.  Create a temp table with limiting criteria to create a smaller / filtered result set.
2.  Join the temp table to the second large table to limit the number of records being fetched and to speed up the query.

This is especially useful when there are no indexes on the join columns.

**Inefficient**

`SELECT col_A, col_B, sum(col_C) total FROM projects.schema_name.table_name pd INNER JOIN projects.schema_name.table_name st ON pd.col_A=st.col_B WHERE pd.col_C like 'DOG%' GROUP BY pd.col_A, pd.col_B, pd.col_C`

Note that even if joining column `col_A` has an index, the `col_B` column does not. In addition, because the size of some tables can be large, one should limit the size of the join table by first building a smaller filtered `#temp` table then performing the table joins.

**Efficient**

``` sql
SET search_path = schema_name;
```

Note: This statement sets the default schema/database to projects.schema_name

**Step 1**:

``` sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_table (col_A varchar(14), col_B varchar(178), col_C varchar(4));
```

**Step 2**:

``` sql
INSERT INTO temp_table SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C
FROM projects.schema_name.table_name WHERE col_B like 'CAT%';
```

**Step 3**:

``` sql
SELECT pd.col_A, pd.col_B, pd.col_C, sum(col_C) as total FROM temp_table pd INNER JOIN projects.schema_name.table_name st ON pd.col_A=st.col_B GROUP BY pd.col_A, pd.col_B, pd.col_C;

DROP TABLE temp_table;
```

Note always drop the temp table after the analysis is complete to release data from physical memory.

### Other Pointers for best database performance

**`SELECT` columns, not stars**. Specify the columns you’d like to include in the results (though it’s fine to use `*` when first exploring tables — just remember to LIMIT your results).

**Avoid using `SELECT DISTINCT`**. The \`SELECT DISTINCT1 command in Amazon Redshift used for fetching unique results and remove duplicate rows in the relation. To achieve this task, it basically groups together related rows and then removes them. GROUP BY operation is a costly operation. To fetch distinct rows and remove duplicate rows, use more attributes in the SELECT operation.

Inner joins vs `WHERE` clause. Use inner join for merging two or more tables rather than using the `WHERE` clause. The `WHERE` clause creates the CROSS join/ CARTESIAN product for merging tables. The CARTESIAN product of two tables takes a lot of time.

`IN` versus `EXISTS`. The `IN` operator is costlier than `EXISTS` in terms of scans especially when the result of the subquery is a large dataset. We should try to use `EXISTS` rather than using `IN` for fetching results with a subquery.

**Avoid**

``` sql
SELECT col_A , col_B, col_C

FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE col_A IN

(SELECT col_B FROM projects.schema_name.table_name WHERE col_B = 'DOG')
```

**Prefer**

``` sql
SELECT col_A , col_B, col_C

FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE EXISTS

(SELECT col_A FROM projects.schema_name.table_name b WHERE

a.col_A = b.col_B and b.col_B = 'DOG')
```

Query optimizers can change the order of the following list, but this general lifecycle of a Amazon Redshift query is good to keep in mind when writing Amazon Redshift.

1.  `FROM` (and `JOIN`) get(s) the tables referenced in the query.
2.  `WHERE` filters data.
3.  `GROUP BY` aggregates data.
4.  `HAVING` filters out aggregated data that doesn’t meet the criteria.
5.  `SELECT` grabs the columns (then deduplicates rows if `DISTINCT` is invoked).
6.  `UNION` merges the selected data into a result set.
7.  `ORDER BY` sorts the results.

### Amazon Redshift best practices for `FROM`

Join tables using the ON keyword. Although it’s possible to “join” two tables using a `WHERE` clause, use an explicit `JOIN`. The `JOIN` + `ON` syntax distinguishes joins from `WHERE` clauses intended to filter the results.

``` sql
SET search_path = schema_name; -– this statement sets the default schema/database to projects.schema_name

SELECT A.col_A , B.col_B, B.col_C

FROM projects.schema_name.table_name as A

JOIN projects.schema_name.table_name B ON A.col_A = B.col_B
```

*Alias multiple tables*. When querying multiple tables, use aliases, and employ those aliases in your select statement, so the database (and your reader) doesn’t need to parse which column belongs to which table.

**Avoid**

``` sql
SET search_path = schema_name; -– this statement sets the default schema/database to projects.schema_name

SELECT col_A , col_B, col_C

FROM dbo.table_name as A

LEFT JOIN dbo.table_name as B ON A.col_A = B.col_B
```

**Prefer**

``` sql
SET search_path = schema_name;– this statement sets the default schema/database to projects.schema_name

SELECT A.col_A , B.col_B, B.col_C

FROM dbo.table_name as A

LEFT JOIN dbo.table_name as B

A.col_A = B.col_B
```

### Amazon Redshift best practices for WHERE

Filter with `WHERE` before `HAVING`. Use a `WHERE` clause to filter superfluous rows, so you don’t have to compute those values in the first place. Only after removing irrelevant rows, and after aggregating those rows and grouping them, include a HAVING clause to filter out aggregates.

Avoid functions on columns in `WHERE` clauses. Using a function on a column in a WHERE clause can really slow down your query, as the function prevents the database from using an index to speed up the query. Instead of using the index to skip to the relevant rows, the function on the column forces the database to run the function on each row of the table. The concatenation operator \|\| is also a function, so don’t try to concat strings to filter multiple columns. Prefer multiple conditions instead:

**Avoid**

``` sql
SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE concat(col_A, col_B) = 'REGULARCOFFEE'
```

**Prefer**

``` sql
SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE col_A ='REGULAR' and col_B = 'COFFEE'
```

### Amazon Redshift best practices for GROUP BY

Order multiple groupings by descending cardinality. Where possible, GROUP BY columns in order of descending cardinality. That is, group by columns with more unique values first (like IDs or phone numbers) before grouping by columns with fewer distinct values (like state or gender).

### Amazon Redshift best practices for HAVING

Only use `HAVING` for filtering aggregates. Before `HAVING`, filter out values using a `WHERE` clause before aggregating and grouping those values.

``` sql
SELECT col_A, sum(col_B) as total_amt

FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE col_C = 1617 and col_A='key'

GROUP BY col_A

HAVING sum(col_D)> 0
```

### Amazon Redshift best practices for UNION

Prefer `UNION ALL` to `UNION`. If duplicates are not an issue, `UNION ALL` won’t discard them, and since `UNION ALL` isn’t tasked with removing duplicates, the query will be more efficient.

### Amazon Redshift best practices for ORDER BY

Avoid sorting where possible, especially in subqueries. If you must sort, make sure your subqueries are not needlessly sorting data.

**Avoid**

``` sql
SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C

FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE col_B IN

(SELECT col_A FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE col_C = 534905 ORDER BY col_B);
```

**Prefer**

``` sql
SELECT col_A, col_B, col_C

FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE col_A IN

(SELECT col_B FROM projects.schema_name.table_name

WHERE col_C = 534905);
```

### Troubleshooting Queries

There are several metrics for calculating the cost of the query in terms of storage, time, CPU utilization. However, these metrics require DBA permissions to execute. Follow up with ADRF support to get additional assistance.

Using the `SVL_QUERY_SUMMARY` view: To analyze query summary information by stream, do the following:

**Step 1**: `select query, elapsed, substring from svl_qlog order by query desc limit 5;`

**Step 2**: `select * from svl_query_summary where query = MyQueryID order by stm, seg, step;`

***Execution Plan***: Lastly, an execution plan is a detailed step-by-step processing plan used by the optimizer to fetch the rows. It can be enabled in the database using the following procedure:

1.  Click on SQL Editor in the menu bar.
2.  Click on Explain Execution Plan.

It helps to analyze the major phases in the execution of a query. We can also find out which part of the execution is taking more time and optimize that sub-part. The execution plan shows which tables were accessed, what index scans were performed for fetching the data. If joins are present it shows how these tables were merged. Further, we can see a more detailed analysis view of each sub-operation performed during query execution.
