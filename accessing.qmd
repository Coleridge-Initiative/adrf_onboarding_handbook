### External Data and Code

Please note that importing of external data and code is restricted to only Coleridge staff. Given the secure and protected environment provided by the ADRF, all code, data, and packages that are coming from outside of the ADRF must be carefully vetted to prevent leaks, disclosure, or unauthorized access. This means that there is no direct method for uploading data or code from your system to the ADRF. Please contact [support\@coleridgeinitiative.org](mailto:support@coleridgeinitiative.org "mailto:support@coleridgeinitiative.org") for any questions or assistance on importing your own code, data, or packages.
